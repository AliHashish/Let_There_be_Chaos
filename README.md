"Let There Be Chaos" is the theme of our rather chaotic game.

Our game follows the tales of a heroic cow - named Kaw - that was sent to space in order to protect earth from hurdling asteroids that threaten its safety. Kaw was promised a luxurious life with an abundance of food if it is successful in saving earth. However, after arduosly saving earth, humans betray Kaw by refusing to return it back to earth, thinking that it's too powerful to contain.

In its fury, Kaw decides to destroy the solar system to exact revenge on humanity, and thus begins quite the choatic journey of a space cow.
